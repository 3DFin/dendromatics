    """This function finds outlier tilting values among sections within a tree
    and assigns a score to the sections based on those outliers. Two kinds of
    outliers are considered.

        - Absolute outliers are obtained from the sum of the deviations from
          every section center to all axes within a tree (the most tilted sections
          relative to all axes)

        - Relative outliers are obtained from the deviations of other section
          centers from a certain axis, within a tree (the most tilted sections
          relative to a certain axis)

    The 'outlier score' consists on a weighted sum of the absolute tilting value
    and the relative tilting value.
