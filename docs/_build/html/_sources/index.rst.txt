dendromatics: Automatic dendrometry in terrestrial point clouds
===============================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

This package provides functionalities to implement an updated version of algorithm presented in [CABO2018]_ to detect the trees present in a terrestrial 3D point cloud from a forest plot, and compute individual tree parameters: tree height, tree location, diameters along the stem (including DBH), and stem axis.
