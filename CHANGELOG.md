and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.2] - 2024-03-14

### Changed

- Take advantage of multiple CPU cores during `DBSCAN` clustering.

### Fixed

- Take into account all iterations in `individualize.compute_axes` to fix inconsistencies with progress bar.

- Update `CSF-3DFin` to version 1.3.0. Thanks to Daniel Girardeau-Montaut,
  and the CloudCompare project, it contains many bug fixes and speed 
  improvements. Most notably, it fixes a race condition that resulted
  in non deterministic executions.

- Fixed a bug that prevent using voxelate with custom xyz component indices

## [0.4.1] - 2024-02-07

### Changed

- Update `CSF` to point to the CSF-3DFin fork. This add a fix that improve numpy array - CSF interop. 
Height normalization processing is faster (depdending the size of the cloud it could be of several orders of magnitude)

## [0.4.0] - 2024-01-24

### Added

- `ground.check_normalization_discrepancy` returns the indicator and the percentage of discrepancy
between the original area and the slice area.

## [0.3.1] - 2024-01-23

### Fixed

- Fixed a malformed call to `voxelate` inside `ground.check_normalization`.

- Fixed the documentation build int RTD.

### Added

- Added an optional group of dependencies for documentation (`docs`) in the project file. 

## [0.3.0] - 2024-01-19

### Changed

- Changed `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` for `scipy.spatial.KDTree` and use parallel queries to speed up computations.

### Fixed

- Removed few harmless unused variables.

- Modified boolean filtering in `clean_cloth()` so it accounts for cases where DTM is completely flat. This happens, for instance, when a DTM is fitted to an already normalized point cloud.

### Added

- Added clearer error messages in certain situations where point density of input point cloud was low and no clusters were found in step "1.-Extracting the stripe and peeling the stems". Previous error messages were Python's defaults "zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity" and "min() arg is an empty sequence".

- Added `ground.check_normalization`. This function slices a normalized point cloud and compares its area vs. a scalar. It's intended use it's to compare the area of a point cloud to the area of a slice of points around ground level from the height-normalized version of the same point cloud. This is useful to check for inconsistencies in the height-normalization.

- Added support of Python 3.12

## [0.2.1] - 2023-07-10

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in clean_ground(). It caused that, during denoising step before dtm computation, the removed points (noise) were independent of the voxel resolution used.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-06-02

### Added

- This CHANGELOG file.
- Documentation is now live at `ReadTheDocs.io`.
- A `process_hook` in order to replace the current embedded progress logging.
- DTM interpolation

### Changed

- `3DFIN` organization was renamed `3DFin`. All links have been changed accordingly.

### Fixed

- Links to `PyPI` and documentation no longer point to placeholders on `README.md`.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-03-27

First public version of dendromatics
